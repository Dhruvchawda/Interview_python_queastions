### 2. **Fibonacci Series**

**Code:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b
        n -= 1

# Example usage
fibonacci(10)
```

**Explanation:**
- The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- This function prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

**Use case:**
- Fibonacci sequences are used in algorithms, dynamic programming problems, and data structures like heaps, trees, and graph traversal.
