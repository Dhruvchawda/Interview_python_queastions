### 5. **Armstrong Number**

**Code:**
```python
def is_armstrong(n):
    num = n
    order = len(str(n))
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        total += digit ** order
        n //= 10
    return total == num

# Example usage
print(is_armstrong(153))  # Output: True
```

**Explanation:**
- An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
- We calculate this for each digit and compare it with the original number.

**Use case:**
- Armstrong numbers are generally used for mathematical puzzles and algorithm optimization tasks.
