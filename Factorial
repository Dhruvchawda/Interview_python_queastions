### 3. **Factorial of a Number**

**Code:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example usage
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

**Explanation:**
- The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from `1` to `n`.
- Itâ€™s calculated recursively in this example.

**Use case:**
- Factorials are widely used in combinatorics, probability theory, and calculating permutations and combinations.
