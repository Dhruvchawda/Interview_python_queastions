### 8. **Count Vowels and Consonants**

**Code:**
```python
def count_vowels_and_consonants(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowels_count = consonants_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                vowels_count += 1
            else:
                consonants_count += 1
    return vowels_count, consonants_count

# Example usage
vowels, consonants = count_vowels_and_consonants("Hello World")
print(f"Vowels: {vowels}, Consonants: {consonants}")
```

**Explanation:**
- This program counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
- It checks if each character is a letter and whether it is a vowel or consonant.

**Use case:**
- String analysis, text processing, and natural language processing (NLP) applications often require counting vowels and consonants.
