### 4. **Prime Number**

**Code:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
print(is_prime(7))  # Output: True
```

**Explanation:**
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- We check divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n` to optimize the check.

**Use case:**
- Prime numbers are used in encryption algorithms (RSA), hashing, and security protocols.
